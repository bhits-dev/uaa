# What is UAA?

CloudFoundry User Account and Authentication (UAA) is used as OAuth2 server in Consent2Share. The UAA is a multi-tenant identity management service, used in Cloud Foundry. But, it is also available as a standalone OAuth2 server. Its primary role is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client applications to use when they act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users. It can also authenticate users with their Cloud Foundry credentials, and can act as an SSO service using those credentials (or others). It has endpoints for managing user accounts and for registering OAuth2 clients, as well as various other management functions.

# How to Use This Image


## Start a UAA instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits/uaa) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name uaa <configuration> -d bhits/uaa:latest`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the [Consent2Share Deployment Guide]() for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*


## Configure

This API need to setup configuration [uaa.yml](https://github.com/bhits/uaa/blob/master/config-template/uaa.yml) properly to run full function.  

Mount [uaa.yml](https://github.com/bhits/uaa/blob/master/config-template/uaa.yml) into docker container under `/java/C2S_PROPS/uaa`.

`docker run -v "/path/on/dockerhost/uaa.yml:/java/C2S_PROPS/uaa/uaa.yml" -d bhits/uaa:latest`

## Environment Variables

When you start the UAA image, you need to configure UAA instance by passing the following environment variables on the command line. 

### UAA_CONFIG_PATH

This environment variable is used to set location of [uaa.yml](https://github.com/bhits/uaa/blob/master/config-template/uaa.yml). The default value is `/java/C2S_PROPS/uaa`. To overwrite this value, pass environment variable `CATALINA_OPTS="-DUAA_CONFIG_PATH=${path}"` 

`docker run --name uaa -v "/path/on/dockerhost/uaa.yml:/path/in/container/uaal.yml" -e CATALINA_OPTS="-DUAA_CONFIG_PATH=/path/in/container" -d bhits/uaa:latest`

### UAA_DB_HOST & UAA_DB_PASSWORD

These two environment variables are used to setup the database url and password. It will connect the database to `jdbc:mysql://${UAA_DB_HOST}:3306/uaa`. For example, if `UAA_DB_HOST=databasehost`, full database url will be `jdbc:mysql://databasehost:3306/uaa`.  Default value of `UAA_DB_PASSWORD` is `admin`

`docker run --name uaa -e UAA_DB_HOST=databasehost -e UAA_DB_PASSWORD=strongpassword -d bhits/uaa:latest`

### UAA_SMTP_HOST & UAA_SMTP_PORT & UAA_SMTP_USER & UAA_SMTP_PASSWORD

These environment variables are used to setup mail host to send email when registering user accounts.

`docker run --name uaa -e UAA_SMTP_HOST=email@emailhost.com -e UAA_SMTP_PORT=25 -e UAA_SMTP_USER=username -e UAA_SMTP_PASSWORD=strongpassword  -d bhits/uaa:latest`

### C2S_APP_HOST & C2S_APP_PORT

These environment variables are related to edge server host and port and are used to reset user account passwords.

`docker run --name uaa -e C2S_APP_HOST=dockerhost -e C2S_APP_PORT=80 -d bhits/uaa:latest`
